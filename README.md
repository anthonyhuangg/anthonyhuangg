## Hi there 👋
I'm Anthony — an Actuarial Studies & Computer Science student at UNSW passionate about backend systems, quantitative risk modeling, and applied machine learning.

I’m currently building **ParkPilot**, a smart parking management platform with a FastAPI backend, real-time routing, and a React Native frontend. I’ve also developed a **Market Data Distribution Server** using gRPC and asyncio for low-latency order book streaming.
